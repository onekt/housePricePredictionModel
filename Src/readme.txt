# Source code (modular scripts)

Clean, modular code

Store Python scripts for modular code (cleaning, training, evaluating)

Once you know what works, you clean up your code from notebooks and move it into src/ as organized, reusable, and well-tested functions and classes. This is your projectâ€™s core logic.
